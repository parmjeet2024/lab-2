Cat Selector App
Welcome and hi there to the Cat Selector App! This is a web app where you can choose the ideal cat breed based on your requirement from various aspects like intelligence, weight, diseases, etc.
It is based on The Cat API data, which gives us data about various things for different breeds.
What's New in This App?
Following is what this application does and how it has been made more user-friendly:
1. Fetching 67 Cat Breeds
This application retrieves 67 different cat breeds using an API. We get all the data for each breed, i.e., their names, diseases, weight, and intelligence. You can display them and arrange them as per your requirement.
2. View All Cat Names
Tapping the "All Names" button will provide a list of all 67 cat breeds. Try this to see what's available!
3. Filter Cats according to Health Issues
If you'd prefer to look for a specific health issue (e.g., allergies or heart concerns), you can enter the number of such a health issue into the app's input field.
The "Filter" button press will give you a list of cats that have that specific condition.
4. Change Weight from Imperial to Metric
For weight, we have some who are more comfortable with pounds (imperial) and others with kilograms (metric). You can toggle between the two by using the "Weight" button.
5. See Intelligence and Child-Friendliness
The app will also tell you the children-friendliness and the intelligence of the dogs. You'll be able to understand which breed will perfectly fit your family and lifestyle through this. 6. Calculate Average Intelligence
Want to see the average smarts of all the cats? The app does it for you! You can also see the average smarts of kid-safe cats (cats that are rated kid-safe 7 or above). It is fun to look at the different breeds comparatively in general.
7. Handling Missing Data
If some of the cats lack missing values for qualities like intelligence, the app will not include them when computing averages, and thus you won't receive any bizarre results. It's simply about making it smooth and precise!
8. A Simple Interface The app is designed to be straightforward and plain. Tap on the buttons, fill data into the form fields, and you'll possess what you require in a flash of the eye.
